# Classification-of-Iris-dataset-using-KNN

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

I have performed K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm on the dataset and the classifier is about 95% accurate.
And Neural Networks in Python. Check out both codes.
